### FAQ
#### What is an API key?
An API key is a unique identifier that allows users to communicate with the service's API. An API key can be generated from the "security" tab within digital ocean.

#### Does the key save when i exit the app?
Yes.

#### Does changing options in the app happen on digital ocean?
Yes. The app uses the API from digital ocean and thus any changes made to droplets within the app also happen on digital ocean.
